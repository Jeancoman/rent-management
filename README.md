This is a simple Rent Managment System made with PHP, JavaScript, TailwindCSS and MySQL database for persistence.

**#Database Details**

**host:** localhost
**name:** rent-management
**user:** root
**password:**

**#Testing**

You can test this application using the following users:

**Tenant**

phone_number: 123456789011
password: 12345

**Owner**

phone_number: owner
password: 12345

**#Notes**

Inputs aren't validated, when testing, don't leave them empty or unexpected bugs may appear.

The chat is not Real-Time. Due to time constraints, I couldn't implement WebSockets but other than that it behaves like a normal chat. To send pictures/screenshots, you have to input the URL where the image resource is located and it will be parsed to HTML5.
